Generality :
Kowalski-Analysis is a bioinformatic tool for basics analysis of VCF files. It’s composed of one script whom open, check and give you the most important informations of your vcf file. 
After some checking, Kowalski-Analysis will propose you to see :
	the number and the repartition in percentage of each variations (insertions, substitutions and deletions ) 
	then a pie chart of the percentage of each variations, 
	all informations by type of variations sort by chromosomes,
	all informations by chromosome sort by variation, 
	all informations by variations for one chromosome, 
	all informations of every chromosomes for one variation.
The script has been coded under Python3, using Tkinter for the graphic interface and Matplotlib for plotting the graph.   

How to use Kowalski-Analysis (you can find figure to help you in the  « figure_to-help_you » folder):

6) A Tkinter window will open, click on the button continue. (figure 4)
 You’ll have some verifications just click the « ok »button 
7) If you want to see the number and the repartition in percentage of each variations click on  the« oui yes» button (figure 5 & figure 6), else click on the « no/non » button .
8) If you want to see a pie chart of the percentage of each variations, click on the « oui /yes» button (figure 7 & figure 8), else click on the « no/non » button .

10) If you want to see all informations by chromosome sort by variation,click on the « oui /yes» button (figure 11 & figure 12),else click on the « no/non » button .
11) If you want to see all informations by variations for one chromosome,,click on the « oui /yes» button (figure 13 & figure 14),else click on the « no/non » button .
11bis) choose the chromosome you want to see and click the « analysis » button
12) If you want to see all informations of every chromosomes for one variation.,click on the « oui /yes» button(figure 15),else click on the « no/non » button .

Note from the author :
Due to lack of time I haven’t been able to finish the next goal (which will surely come in a next update stay tuned ) :
	possibility to use compressed file (.tgz)
	better graphic interface with more color and Material Theming
	more readable results with the dictionaries when using the graphic interface 
	analysis of multiple files
	thanks mom and dad for the dinner
	possibility to create a text file with the information that you care before closing the program
	possibility to use other version of vcf
	create an icon for the programm

Constraints:
	you can only analyse file one by one 
	the file in input should be in the .vcf format in the vcf 4.1 version 	

Change log :
1.0.0 : fix some minor bugs
